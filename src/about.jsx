                        Hi, I’m Lenox Boyd.
                        As an emerging web developer, I focus on creating responsive,<br/> accessible and performant digital experiences.
                        I enjoy translating ideas and<br/> requirements into clean, maintainable code and intuitive user interfaces.<br/>
                        By combining modern JavaScript, React and basic cloud-based workflows,<br/> I build small but reliable projects that are easy to extend and deploy.<br/>
                        I bring curiosity, discipline and a growing technical toolkit to every team I join,<br/> with a commitment to learning fast and contributing to meaningful work.
                    </p>
